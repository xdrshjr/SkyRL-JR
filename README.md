# Overview

SkyRL is a full-stack RL library that provides the following components:

- [`skyrl-agent`](./skyrl-agent): Our agent layer for training long-horizon, real-world agents. For exact reproduction of [SkyRL-v0](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-v0) results, please checkout to commit a0d50c482436af7fac8caffa4533616a78431d66.
- [`skyrl-train`](./skyrl-train): Our modular, performant training framework for RL.
- [`skyrl-gym`](./skyrl-gym): Our gymnasium of tool-use tasks, including a library of math, coding, search and SQL environments implemented in the Gymnasium API.
- (**EXPERIMENTAL**) [`skyrl-tx`](./skyrl-tx): A cross-platform library to enable users to expose a local [Tinker](https://thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/)-like REST API for model post-training.

# Getting Started

For a guide on developing with SkyRL, take at look at our [Development Guide](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/development.html) docs.

For model training, checkout [`skyrl-train`](./skyrl-train) to start using, modifying, or building on top of the SkyRL training stack. See our [quickstart docs](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to ramp up!

For building environments, checkout [`skyrl-gym`](./skyrl-gym) to integrate your task in the simple gymnasium interface.

For agentic pipelines, check out [`skyrl-agent`](./skyrl-agent) for our work on optimizing and scaling pipelines for multi-turn tool use LLMs on long-horizon, real-environment tasks.
